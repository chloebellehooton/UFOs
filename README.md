# UFOs


## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Dana wants to provide a way to track UFO data and through this dashboard is providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

If someone wants to look up UFO sightings  they go to our webpage, scroll to the bottom and and fill out the filters as shown in the image and press enter.

### Filters
![search image](https://github.com/chloebellehooton/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/search.png)
- The search filters have placeholder text that represents the formatting needed to filter. The filters are case sensitive so the user needs to use only lowercase. 
- Filters available: 
  - Date
  - City
  - State
  - Country
  - Shape

## Summary:

One drawback of the webpage is that the search filters are case sensitive and there is no way for the user to tell if they mispelled the word or if there aren't any UFO sightings for their criteria
### Two recommendations for further development
- Create a clear filters button so the user doesn't have to manually clear out their previous searches
- Create a drop down of options or a multiple selection option on the filters
